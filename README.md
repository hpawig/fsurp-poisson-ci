# Discrete Confidence Intervals: Poisson

## California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, CA

### Background and Introduction

This project was a part of the Cal Poly SLO Frost Summer Undergraduate Research Program during the Summer of 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Bret A. Holladay. The main objective of this project was to create a Shiny application that provides public access to computation of Poisson confidence intervals, for any of the confidence procedures discovered up to as recent as 2023.

### Contents

*app files* contains the necessary R files to run the application.

*data tables* is a folder which contains Excel (.xlsx) formatted data tables that can be re-used to create the example coverage probability (CPF) plots in the manuscript.

*files* contains a PDF of the manuscript written during the project. The manuscript explains the methods in detail and has example CPF plots. This folder also contains Quarto/R files where the confidence methods' and their corresponding CPFs' original code were created.

*images* is a folder of PNG files of each of the plots in the manuscript (CPFs and comparison plots).

**This research was generously supported by the William and Linda Frost Fund in the Cal Poly Bailey College of Science and Mathematics.**
