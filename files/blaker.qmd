get_mtp <- function(x, lambda) {
  if (x != 0) {
    return(# general case
      min(ppois(x, lambda), # P(X<=x)

# main function

-   Blaker's method involves:

    -   find min tail probability (MTP) of observed x

    -   Fix theta; for all x, find MTPs that are as small or smaller than observed MTP and put those x's in $A_\theta$

    -   observed $x \in A_\theta$ if $P(X \in A_\theta) > \alpha$. Record $\theta$

```{r}
# Process
# 1) find min tail probability (MTP) of observed x
# 2) Fix lambda; for all x, find MTPs that are as small or smaller than observed MTP at that lambda. The observed x is always among these
# 3) observed x is in acceptance set of lambda if P(x in A_lambda) > alpha. Record all lambdas
# 4) lower and upper confidence limits given obs.x are smallest and largest lambdas
#   that have acceptance sets with obs. x , respectively


blaker_CI <- function(x, conf.level = 0.95, digits = 2) {
  # set up
  x0 <- seq(from = 0, to = x*5, by = 1)
  alpha <- 1 - conf.level
  lambda <- seq(0, x*5, 1*10^(-digits))
  p_lambda <- c() # will be used to store all lambda s.t. x in AS_lambda (*plausible* lambdas)
  
  for (i in 1:length(lambda)) {
    AS <- c() # initialize acceptance set vec for lambda[i]
    
    # calculate obs mtp for current lambda
      obs_mtp <- get_mtp(x, lambda[i])
      
      # find all x's with MTP <= observed mtp
      for (j in 1:length(x0)) {
        temp_mtp <- get_mtp(x0[j], lambda[i]) 
        if (temp_mtp <= obs_mtp) {
          # AS will contain all x's resulting in MTP <= obs_mtp at current lambda
          AS <- c(AS, x0[j]) 
        
        } else {  
         # current x0 has mtp above observed mtp, so stop checking more x's
          break
        }
      }
    
      # calculate probability of X being in acceptance set
      if (0 %in% AS) {

      } else if (length(AS) > 0) {
        prob <- ppois(max(AS), lambda[i]) - ppois(min(AS)-1, lambda[i])
      } else {
        prob <- 0
      }

  }

### coverage probability function for Blaker

```{r}
# creating a coverage probability function given one lambda for B method
blaker_CP <- function(lambda, conf.level = 0.95) {

    captured <- c() # initialize
    for (x0 in 0:50) {
      LL <- blaker_CI(x0, conf.level)$lower
      UL <- blaker_CI(x0, conf.level)$upper
    
      if (dplyr::between(lambda, LL, UL) == TRUE) {
        captured <- c(captured,x)
      }
    }
    
  # sum pmf of each x that captures lambda in its CI
    p <- 0
    for (i in 1:length(captured)) {
      p <- p + dpois(captured[i], lambda)
    }
  
 # this is the coverage probability for lambda
  return(p)
}
