# main function

-   Blaker's method involves:

    -   find min tail probability (MTP) of observed x

    -   Fix theta; for all x, find MTPs that are as small or smaller than observed MTP and put those x's in $A_\theta$

    -   observed $x \in A_\theta$ if $P(X \in A_\theta) > \alpha$. Record $\theta$
